# [MarsSite](https://billizane.github.io/vue-awesome-paginate) #

Did you know that NASA puts photos of space :alien: and Mars in the public domain almost every day?

These photos can be obtained via the REST API from NASA. :sunglasses:

Hmmmmm. :nerd_face: Why not make a SPA application to download and view such photos? :thinking: :thinking: :thinking:

We need to make such an application. :smiley_cat: There is no time to wait. :cowboy_hat_face:

Let's go. :rocket:


I present to you a project built on VueJS and NASA REST api. The project is dedicated to Mars.

## Technologies: ##

* Vue.js 3 :zap:
* Pinia :zap:
* Vue Router :zap:
* Vue I18n :zap:
* Vue Datepicker :zap:
* Vue Awesome Paginate :zap:
* Vite :zap:
* JavaScript :zap:
* HTML :zap:
* SASS :zap:

## Libraries ##

* Vue i18n (for multilanguage) :books:
* Vue Awesome Paginate (for pagination) :books:
* Vue Datepicker (for change and select dates of images) :books:

## Interesting features: ##

* Multilingualism. There are 5 languages: English, German, Polish, Ukrainian, Russian :star:
* Convenient calendar for date selection :star:
* There is a convenient filter for filtering images depending on the rover's camera :star:

Attention. :fire: When the site is loaded for the first time and when the main page is updated, the images are loaded not for today's date, but 3 days earlier. Why? :open_mouth: Because the NASA's API has not yet available pictures for today. Therefore, it was decided to use the date 3 days earlier. Of course, all later pictures are uploaded according to the date in the calendar.

## Environment: ##
* Node.js 16.13.0 :zap:
* npm 9.7.1 :zap:
* Vite 4.0.0 :zap:
